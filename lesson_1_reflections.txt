How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-memory is fallable.  I can tell you what project I am working on today and to some certainty I may be able to give you a rough outline of what I have done to that project, but there's no way I could tell word for word what I had changed.  I can only imagine the evolving nature of a program and how much it changes from inception to production.  Having access to every iteration of a project might be the most important thing.
