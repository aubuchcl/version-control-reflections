How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-memory is fallable.  I can tell you what project I am working on today and to some certainty I may be able to give you a rough outline of what I have done to that project, but there's no way I could tell word for word what I had changed.  I can only imagine the evolving nature of a program and how much it changes from inception to production.  Having access to every iteration of a project might be the most important thing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does

if every time i type something it was automatically saved then the log of my versions would be so insanely big that I would never be able to tell where the version I was looking for started.  


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

google docs was built with a single file in mind.  You have to open one file at a time or have many windows open and there really is no "manual" saving.  Git was build on the idea that you would have control over your versions and leo understood that many files that rely on  each other to work correctly may need to maintained at once.
